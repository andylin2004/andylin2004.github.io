    In the Low Power Mode Toggler, Test Timer, StickerCord, Talon, and Tides apps, diagnostic data related to device OS is collected to determine future support for the app. This data is for internal use only and will not be sold. In addition, in the Tides app, location data is used locally to determine the nearest stations to show to the user and to determine how the stations to add are sorted. This data is not sent anywhere else. No other data is collected.
