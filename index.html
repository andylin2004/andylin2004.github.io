            <h2>Hi there! I'm Andy Lin.</h2>
            <p>I'm a student at New York University (class of 2026) majoring in Computer Science and minoring in
                Integrated Design and Media and an alumni of Stuyvesant High School (class of 2022). I also develop apps
                for Apple platforms (such as iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS), available on the Apple App
                Store. I typically program in Python and Swift, but, I also have experience programming in C, C#, C++,
                Java, Lua (including Roblox's Luau fork), and Rust. When I'm not busy doing coursework or developing my
                apps, I do photography, as well as rowing on the Hudson River.</p>
