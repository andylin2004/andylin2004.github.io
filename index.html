                <h2>Hi there! I'm Andy Lin.</h2>
                <p>I'm a student at New York University (class of 2025) majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Integrated Design and Media and an alumni of Stuyvesant High School (class of 2022). I also develop a few apps for Apple platforms (such as iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS), available on the Apple App Store. I typically program in Python and Swift, but, I also have experience programming in C, C#, C++, Java, Lua (including Roblox's Luau fork), and Rust. When I'm not busy doing coursework or developing my apps, I can be seen taking photographs of life's wonders or the wonderful places around the world, as well as rowing in the Hudson River.</p>
