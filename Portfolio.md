## Project Portfolio

### [Haptiphones](https://github.com/andylin2004/sldp-audio-processing)
A RAD project targeted at deaf people created for EG1004's Semester Long Design Project. This project involved adding a set of vibration motors to a preexisting pair of headphones, connecting the motors to a power source and a Raspberry Pi 4, and programming the Raspberry Pi so that it could process music sent to the Raspberry Pi and make the vibration motors vibrate to the currently playing music.

### [Tides App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tides-high-and-low-tide-info/id1583238971)
An app for iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS devices specifically designed for watercraft users to know tide conditions and when the tides will change. Widgets are also available for users to view this information on their Home Screen or Lock Screen (on iOS and iPadOS) or on their watch face (on watchOS).

Also supports notifying the user that they can enable Low Power Mode when the MacBook goes down to 20% health (if notifications are enabled).

### [windows-swiftui](https://github.com/andylin2004/windows-swiftui)
An experiment in creating a windowing system within SwiftUI. However, since the App Store doesn't allow for individual windows within an app itself, this will probably never be used to create an actual app.
