[Improved the handling of setting the size of the simulator window](https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/pull/692)

*The PR was closed but the feature was [implemented](https://openbve-project.net/intro/v1.8.2.0/) through a proper NuGet package since macOS doesn't support compilation of NuGet packages.*
