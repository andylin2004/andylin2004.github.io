A project targeted at deaf people, but useful to anyone, created as part of  EG-UY 1004's Semester Long Design Project. This project involved adding a set of vibration motors to a preexisting pair of headphones, connecting the motors to a power source and a Raspberry Pi 4, and programming the Raspberry Pi in Python so that it could process music sent to the Raspberry Pi and make the vibration motors vibrate to the currently playing music.
