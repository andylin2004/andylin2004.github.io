A macOS Menu Bar Extra App that allows MacBook owners to toggle Low Power Mode from the menu bar without having to dig through System Preferences for the Low Power Mode toggle. Also supports notifying the user that they can enable Low Power Mode when the MacBook goes down to 20% health (if notifications are enabled).
