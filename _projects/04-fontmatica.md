A cool little web app, built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS, designed to manipulate the shape of a word string inputted into the website by shifting it by a sine or cosine graph (or by random amounts). This web app supports uploading custom font files so that users can manipulate word strings typeset in their own font.
