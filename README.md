## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy, a student majoring in Computer Science at New York University (class of 2026), alumni of Stuyvesant High School (class of 2022), and developer from New York, NY. The majority of my repos here as of right now are from my high school and college computer science classes, although I do have a few side projects here. I typically program in Swift, C++, and Rust, although I have experience programming in C, C#, Java and Luau (Roblox's fork of Lua), and Python.
