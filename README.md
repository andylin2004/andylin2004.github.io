## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy, a student at Stuyvesant High School and developer from New York, NY. The majority of my repos here as of right now are from my high school computer science classes, although I do have a few side projects here. I usually program in Swift, Python, and Rust, although I also have experience programming in Java, C, C#, and Luau (Roblox's fork of Lua).

### [windows-swiftui](https://github.com/andylin2004/windows-swiftui)
An experiment in creating a windowing system within SwiftUI. However, since the App Store doesn't allow for individual windows within an app itself, this will probably never be used to create an actual app.
